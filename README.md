# GitHub Action: Verify All Reviewers 

Currently, there is not an option within GitHubâ€™s "Branch Protection Rules" to ensure that all reviewers have approved a pull request. As part of treating meetings as code, we require all attendees to sign off (approve) meeting notes. The approval will 1) confirm their presence at the meeting and 2) represent a blessing of the final meeting notes being submitted.   

## Development
